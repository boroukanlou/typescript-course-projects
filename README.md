## TypeScript Course Projects

This repository contains two separate projects: one for managing course goals and another for creating and managing timers using React and TypeScript.

### Projects

1. **Course Goals App**: A simple React application for managing course goals. Users can define their course goals with specific titles and descriptions, and they can also delete goals.
